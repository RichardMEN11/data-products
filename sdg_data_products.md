## SDGs and Data Products

Target 13 - Activities for climate protection

### Examples

#### GeoPard Agriculture

GeoPard Agriculture has created a precision farming platform for enterprises and individuals. The platform uses open-data sources, such as satellites, to generate a spectrum of information about farmlands. With the help of viewers with different color distributions, users can visualize and analyze crop yield, vegetation health and distribution, leaf chlorophyll production, soil content, water distribution, and other related indices. Additionally, it offers prescription maps to make spraying, seeding, and fertilization practices more effective.

#### Circular IQ

For the Dutch startup Circular IQ, sustainability should be everyone's personal responsibility. Inspired by this, the company was founded with the mission of empowering businesses and governments to activate their entire supply chain and to become game-changers in achieving their sustainability goals. Circular IQ facilitates this with its digital platform, which helps users leverage their purchasing power by selecting materials with defined and verifiable circular characteristics.

## Problem Statement

Target 13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.

"We as humans cannot think just in numbers and we tend to forget how our daily actions impact the climate"

Data products can help there: On the one hand they can make visible how much we as humans harm the planet. On the other hand they can help people to understand that in a more visible way. As data is not a language everyone speaks it needs some products to make that more visible.
